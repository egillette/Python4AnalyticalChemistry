    "To compare your various indicator data, we need to process the data a little bit (to get averages and standard deviations, at least) and then you need to set up the F test and T-tests to then make a decision. In computer programming, decisions are often made with an \"if - then\" format. In this case, we might say \"if Fcalc is less than Ftable then we must run the t-test for unequal variances\". Make a plan for how to approach the question: are these two indicators providing the same results?\n",
