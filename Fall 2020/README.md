The modules present and associated input files are as follows:
1. Statistical Data Processing (two files)
  * Exp. 1 Statistical Data Processing-Fa2020.ipynb
  * Lab1olderData.csv
2. pH calculations
* Module 2 Postlab calculations.ipynb
* PythonLab #1 Calculating pH.ipynb
3. Linear Regressions 
* Graphing and Fitting Data in Python.ipynb
* PythonLab #2 - Linear Regression and Error.ipynb
* drylabdata.csv
4. Standard Additions and Uncertainty Analysis
* Module 4 Standard Addition.ipynb
5. Method Optimization
* Module 5 HPLC retention modeling Fall 2020.ipynb
* HPLCphiData2.csv
* <b> pending - add lab handout files </b>
