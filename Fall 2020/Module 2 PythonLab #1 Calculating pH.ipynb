    "# Acid Base Titration\n",

    "Here we're going to consider calculating the pH during the titration of a weak acid with a strong base. We'll start with values from problem 11-B in the textbook: \n",
    "We'll do calculations for titrating a 50 mL solution of 0.05 M formic acid with 0.05 M KOH, and we'll make Python calculate the pH for a LOT of different volumes of added base.\n",

    "## Outlining your strategy\n",
    "<b>Brainstorm a strategy for your calculation in your ELN</b> if you haven't already done so.  You should be able to break this calculation down into four distinct regions where you solve for pH using different strategies. Write out in words what those regions are, and try to formulate an if-then statement that will help you decide which region you are in and what pH calculation to make in that region:\n",

    "    Region 1:\n",

    "    Region 3:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Region 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have shared your plan for all four regions with Dr. D, start transforming your strategy into Python code.  As you develop your code, it is best to test it out one IF statement section at a time. You can do this by cutting and pasting code into the empty code block below for testing. Once all four IF statements are working, then try running the entire thing!  Alternatively, you could complete all the if statements, then comment out the pH.append statements of the sections you haven't yet completed.\n",
