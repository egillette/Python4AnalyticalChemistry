The next line calls the \"sortRowWise\" subroutine and sends it the array \"m\".  Python then finds where this subroutine is defined and runs it, line by line, until it hits \"return 0,\" the end of the subroutine.  (The subroutine can call the input variable(s) whatever it wants -- the name does not have to match the call statement (\"m\"), although in this case it does.)  Once the subroutine ends, Python jumps back to the call statement with the array \"m\" that has been modified by the subroutine, and continues through the program from there.  Subroutines are convenient ways to incorporate common tasks -- and other people's code -- into your Python code.\n",
