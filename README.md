# Python4AnalyticalChemistry
Jupyter Notebooks and supporting files for incorporating Python programming into a lower division analytical chemistry course

This repository contains files associated with the University of San Diego's CHEM 220 course, developed and implimented by Dr. Eleanor Gillette, Dr. David De Haan and Dr. Julia Schafer as described in (preprint, manuscript). 

Here you will find three interations of our modular integration of Python into our course. In each folder, you will find the Jupyter notebooks associated with each Python assignment, as well as supporting information like sample input files and lab handouts. Instructors interested in completed copies of any notebooks here should contact the authors directly.
