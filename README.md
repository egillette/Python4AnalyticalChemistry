# Python4AnalyticalChemistry
Jupyter Notebooks and supporting files for incorporating Python programming into a lower division analytical chemistry course

This repository contains files associated with the University of San Diego's CHEM 220 course, developed and implimented by Dr. Eleanor Gillette, Dr. David De Haan and Dr. Julia Schafer as described in (preprint, manuscript). <b> Please be patient: this repo is currently a work in progress </b>

Here you will find three interations of our modular integration of Python into our course, as implimented by the different instructors, under different course circumstances. In particular, please note that Spring 2020 was partially, and unexpectedly remote in formate, while Fall 2020 was remote in format for the whole semester. In each folder, you will find the Jupyter notebooks associated with each Python assignment, as well as supporting information like sample input files and lab handouts. Instructors interested in completed copies of any notebooks here should contact the authors directly. Each folder contains a README file which includes a contents list for the folder. All activties are organized by module, so that you can easily locate assignments related to the topic you are interested in. The modules are as follows:

<b> Intro </b>  Working with Jupyter notebooks

<b>Module 1.</b> Simple statistical methods; including t and F tests, quantifying random error

<b>Module 2.</b> Equilbrium: pH & acid-base concepts/calcs, titration curves

<b>Module 3.</b> Linear Regressions, Standard Addition & Uncertainty Analysis (error propogation)

<b>Module 4.</b> Method optimization

<b> Files from previous semesters: </b> Examples of how the modules have been implimnented in various years, to adapt to instructor preferences or other needs. 


There are often more than one assignment per module, and different iterations of the course contain different laboratory excersises that align with each quantitative topic. Laboratory handouts which go along with each assignment are also available, for your information.
